            You see, the Aipysurus Apraefrontalis is a species of snake also known as the "short-nosed sea snake". 
            <br>The problem here is the decrease of population with them, from the diagram below you can see they are
            highlighted as "CR".<br>

        This species has gone from being the third most commonly recorded sea snake in the 1990s to no individuals being <br>recorded in intensive surveys since 2000, indicating a decline of at least 90% in the past 15 years (three generation lengths).<br>Threats are largely unknown, however, declines are possibly due to habitat degradation from coral bleaching and decline of ecosystem health.
